    <title>Final Summary of Evidence and Charges of Thai War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Urgent International Appeal: Thailand Accused of War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity</h1>
    <p><strong>August 4, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This report has been compiled to consolidate all available evidence and legal charges against the Kingdom of Thailand for its acts of aggression and atrocities committed during the recent border conflict. We, the people of Cambodia, appeal to the international community for justice and immediate intervention.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="charges">
        <h2>Summary of Key Charges</h2>
        <p>Based on the events that have occurred and credible reports, the Thai side is accused of committing the following grave crimes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crime of Aggression:</strong> Illegally initiating military force against the sovereignty of Cambodia.</li>
            <li><strong>Crimes Against Humanity:</strong> The kidnapping of Cambodian soldiers as hostages, and systematic acts of torture and inhumane treatment.</li>
            <li><strong>War Crimes:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hostage-Taking:</strong> The capture of 19 Cambodian soldiers during a ceasefire and their use as "human shields" for negotiation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Torture and Inhumane Treatment of POWs:</strong> Resulting in one soldier developing a severe mental disorder and another sustaining injuries during detention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use of Prohibited Weapons:</strong> The use of cluster bombs and the alleged use of poisonous smoke/chemical agents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deliberate Attacks on Cultural Heritage:</strong> Firing MK-82 bombs at the Preah Vihear and Ta Krabey temple areas, both UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mutilation of the Bodies of Deceased POWs:</strong> The return of a Cambodian soldier's body in a decapitated state.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Violation of International Law:</strong> Gross breaches of the Kuala Lumpur Ceasefire Agreement and the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Chronology of Evidence and Atrocities</h2>
    <p>This timeline of events substantiates the charges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial Provocation:</strong> Thailand initiated the conflict with economic pressure, a military buildup, and a deceptive mine-related incident to create a pretext for aggression.</li>
        <li><strong>Outbreak of War (July 24):</strong> Thailand began a direct assault at the Ta Mom temple area following a drone surveillance flight.</li>
        <li><strong>Hostage-Taking and POW Abuse (July 29 onwards):</strong> Thailand violated a ceasefire by using a deceptive trick ("coming to shake hands") to capture approximately 20 Cambodian soldiers. They later reversed a promise of release, using the soldiers as hostages for interrogation. Evidence of torture and inhumane treatment is confirmed by the return of one injured soldier and one suffering from a severe mental disorder.</li>
        <li><strong>Use of Illegal Weapons and Destruction of Heritage:</strong> The Thai military has used F-16 jets, MK-82 bombs, and cluster munitions, deliberately targeting protected cultural heritage sites.</li>
        <li><strong>Humanitarian Crisis:</strong> The conflict has led to the displacement of over 160,000 refugees, a clear sign of the grave impact on the civilian population.</li>
        <li><strong>Current State of Crisis (August 3):</strong> An urgent statement from Samdech Hun Sen confirms the high possibility of a renewed Thai military attack, underscoring the extreme national emergency and the ongoing threat of aggression.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Urgent Call to International Action</h2>
    <p>We make a final, urgent appeal to the international community and all relevant bodies to take immediate action:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Investigation by the ICC:</strong> We call on the International Criminal Court to open an immediate and full investigation into the crimes of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.</li>
        <li><strong>Intervention by the UN Security Council:</strong> Impose immediate economic sanctions and an arms embargo on Thailand, and order a genuine, verifiable ceasefire and the release of all hostages.</li>
        <li><strong>Access for the ICRC:</strong> Demand unrestricted access for the International Committee of the Red Cross to inspect the status of the remaining captured soldiers and provide support to those who have been affected.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="personal-statement">
        <p>I am not just a Cambodian citizen; I am a human being. I wholeheartedly condemn the Thai army for its crimes against humanity and its war crimes. Allowing such cruel acts to occur without accountability is unacceptable. Peace and justice must prevail for the people of Cambodia.</p>
