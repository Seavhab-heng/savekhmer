            <h1>Final draft of evidence and indictment of Thai war crimes and crimes against humanity</h1>
            <p>**(August 4, 2025)**</p>
            <p>This report has been prepared to consolidate all evidence and charges collected to date, in order to file a complaint against Thailand with international courts for the acts of aggression and atrocities committed during the border conflict.</p>
            
            <img src="https://mpics-cdn-acc.mgronline.com/pics/Images/568000007610402.JPEG.webp" alt="Image related to the Cambodia-Thailand conflict.">
            
            <h2>1. Summary of Key Charges</h2>
            <p>Based on the actual events that have occurred and the claims from high-ranking Cambodian officials, as well as direct witnesses, the Thai side has committed the following grave crimes:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crime of Aggression:</strong> The provocation and initiation of the illegal use of military force against Cambodia's sovereignty.</li>
                <li><strong>Crimes Against Humanity:</strong> The kidnapping of Cambodian soldiers as hostages, and acts of torture and inhumane treatment that appear systematic.</li>
                <li><strong>War Crimes:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hostage-Taking:</strong> The capture of 19 Cambodian soldiers during a ceasefire and their use as "bait and human shields" for negotiation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Torture and Inhumane Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs):</strong> Which resulted in one soldier suffering from a severe mental disorder and another being wounded during their detention.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use of Prohibited Weapons:</strong> The use of cluster bombs and the alleged use of poisonous smoke/chemical weapons.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deliberate Attacks on Cultural Heritage:</strong> The firing of MK-82 bombs at the Preah Vihear and Ta Krabey temple areas, which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mutilation of the Bodies of Deceased POWs:</strong> The return of a Cambodian soldier's body in a decapitated state.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Violations of International Law and Key Conventions:</strong> Violations of the Kuala Lumpur Ceasefire Agreement and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Chronology of Evidence and Detailed Events</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Provocation:</strong> Thailand began with economic pressure, a military buildup, and a mine-related incident to create a pretext for aggression.</li>
                <li><strong>Outbreak of War (July 24):</strong> Thailand initiated a direct attack in the Ta Mom temple area following a drone surveillance flight.</li>
                <li><strong>Hostage-Taking Crime (July 29):</strong> Thailand violated the KL Ceasefire Agreement by using a deceptive trick ("coming to shake hands") to capture approximately 20 Cambodian soldiers. During the capture, they shot down two soldiers. Later, they reneged on their promise of release and used these soldiers as hostages for interrogation.</li>
                <li><strong>Evidence of Torture:</strong> The return of two soldiers, one injured and the other with a <strong>mental disorder</strong>, which serves as strong evidence of severe psychological torture during their detention.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of Illegal Weapons and Destruction of Heritage:</strong> The use of F-16 jets to fire rockets, MK-82 bombs, and cluster bombs at the Preah Vihear and Ta Krabey temple areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Atrocities Against Humanity:</strong> The return of a Cambodian soldier's body in a decapitated state, an act of cruelty that goes beyond human morality.</li>
                <li><strong>Ongoing Crisis (August 3):</strong> An urgent statement from Hun Sen indicated a high possibility that Thailand could attack again tonight, confirming the genuine threat of aggression and the highest level of national tension.</li>
                <li><strong>Humanitarian Impact:</strong> The war has caused the displacement of over 160,000 refugees, which is evidence of the severe impact on the civilian population.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Final Urgent Appeal</h2>
            <p>As a human being who recognizes the dignity and rights of all humanity, I/we wholeheartedly condemn the Thai army for its crimes against humanity and war crimes.</p>
            <p>I/we make a final appeal to the international community and all relevant bodies to take the most urgent action:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC):</strong> We call on the ICC to open an immediate and full investigation into the crimes of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity detailed above.</li>
                <li><strong>Intervention by the UN Security Council:</strong> Impose immediate economic sanctions and an arms embargo on Thailand, and order a genuine, verifiable ceasefire and the release of all hostages.</li>
                <li><strong>Access for the ICRC:</strong> Demand unrestricted access for the International Committee of the Red Cross to inspect the status of the remaining captured soldiers and to provide psychological support to those who have been affected.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Allowing such cruel crimes to occur without accountability is unacceptable. Peace and justice must prevail for the people of Cambodia.</p>
