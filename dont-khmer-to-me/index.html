        <h2>Understanding "Khmer" as a Verb</h2>
        <p>In this context, <strong>"to Khmer"</strong> is a slang term that refers to acting in a manner that is excessively **innocent, friendly, or naive**. The origin of the phrase links this behavior to the cultural perception of the Khmer people as being kind, innocent, and sincere. Therefore, "to Khmer" implies a person is being a "good person" or a "perfect person" but often in an insincere or disingenuous way.</p>

        <h2>The Full Meaning of the Phrase</h2>
        <p>When someone says "Don't Khmer to me," they are essentially saying, **"Don't pretend to be innocent with me"** or **"Don't try to deceive me with your sincere-looking behavior."** The speaker is expressing that they see through the other person's facade and are not fooled by their friendly or naive act. It's a way of calling out a perceived lack of sincerity.</p>
